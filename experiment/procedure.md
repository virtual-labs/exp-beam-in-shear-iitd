<h3>Procedure</h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Place the beam on the loading frame</li>
<li>Measure and note the depth (D), width (w) and length (L) of the beam before starting the experiment. </li>
<li>Measure and note the distance between the loading points and supports.</li>
<li>Apply the load with uniform increment in the load using a hydraulic jet. Apply the load slowly and steadily.</li>
<li>As the cracks appear on the beam, stop increasing the load and mark the cracks.</li>
<li>Repeat step 5 at least for 3 different loads</li>
<li>Increase the load till the failure occurs and then note the failure load.</li>
<li>Then stop the loading when the failure crack appears which spreads across the width of the beam.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Observations and Calculations</h3>

<li>Grade of concrete (f<sub>ck</sub>)                               =</li>
<li>Mean compressive strength of concrete (f<sub>cm</sub>)           =</li>
<li>Grade of steel (f<sub>y</sub>)                                   =</li>
<li>Mean Yield strength of steel(f<sub>ym</sub>)                     =</li>
<li>Area of tension steel(A<sub>st</sub>)                            =</li>
<li>Length of Beam Between Supports(Lâ€™/3)                 =</li>
<li>Depth of Beam(D)                                      =</li>
<li>Width of Beam(b)                                      =</li>
<li>Effective depth of beam (d)                           =</li>
<li>Length of crack from support(a)                       =</li>
</ol>

Predicted value of shear strength (V<sub>pred</sub>)(refer to Table 19, Theory)= 
Taking:
<ol>
<li>Failure Load : P</li>
<li>Overall depth of beam : D</li>
<li>Breadth of Beam : b</li>
</ol>
Taking the approximate section to calculate self-weight as trapezium the volume of the same is:
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/fig18.png"></div>
<br>
Comparing the two values gives us the factor of safety (FOS). The Factor of safety is defined as the ratio of V<sub>obs</sub> and V<sub>pred</sub>.
FOS = V<sub>obs</sub> / V<sub>pred</sub>

</ol>
<br>
<h4>Precautions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Before casting, ensure the beam section is without shear reinforcements and under reinforced.</li>
<li>Mix design calculations before preparing concrete for casting should be accurate.</li>
<li>Ensure compaction of the beam is done properly, to obtain accurate test results.</li>
<li>Testing must be done after a minimum of 28 days.</li>
<li>Before testing the beam, check if the load cell and hydraulic jet are functioning properly.</li>
<li>Wear safety helmets while marking the cracks on the beam.</li>
